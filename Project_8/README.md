### Detailed Information:

* **SharedPreferences** 
  * This is a class used for managing preference files. These files have a tabular structure with two columns:
    * **Key** - A string variable representing the name of a stored value.
    * **Value** - This can be a variable of type String, Integer, Float, Double, Set, or Boolean.
  * These files offer a persistent storage mechanism. Their lifespan is equivalent to the presence of the application on the mobile device. The main objectives of the `SharedPreferences` class are:
    * Loading the preference files into memory.
    * Reading information from the file using various `get` type methods.
    * Creating objects of the `Editor` type.

* **Editor** 
  * This class is used for writing to preference files. It provides various `put` methods which allow data to be written into the file.

* **getSharedPreferences** 
  * This method is available within an activity. It facilitates the creation of `SharedPreferences` objects. The method requires two input parameters:
    * **File Name** - The name of the preference file.
    * **Access Mode** - The mode in which the file can be accessed. By default, it's recommended to use `MODE_PRIVATE`, which restricts access to the file exclusively to the application that defined it.

* **apply** 
  * A method available within the `Editor` class. It ensures the actual data is saved to the preference file.

In summary, `SharedPreferences` provides a convenient way to store simple key-value pairs persistently on an Android device. This storage is private to the application, making it a secure place to store sensitive or user-specific information, though it is advisable to avoid storing highly sensitive data like passwords or encryption keys even in `SharedPreferences`.
